This week we covered the basics of learning how to write Python. We learnt about:

- Variables
- Functions

The code from this week is in `week-1.py`.

## Extra challenges
For those of you wanting something a little extra, try and implement the following challenges. The answers are provided in `challenge-answers.py`

1. Create a `turn_left` function.
2. We've called all our movement functions inside `on_button_a_pressed`. Move all of those function calls into a new function ( call it whatever you like ) and call the new function from `on_button_a_pressed`.
3. Create a `turn_around` function which turns the rocky around.
